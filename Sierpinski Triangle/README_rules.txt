Constraint: 1D

Rule:
Cell N is marked (or stays marked) black if and only if either one of its neighbouring cells (N + 1) or (N - 1) are marked black. If both (N + 1) and (N - 1) are marked white or marked black, N is marked (or stays marked) black.

This rule yields the Sierpinski Triangle, a well known class of geometrical objects.
