Cellular automata are a type of program where an array of sequencially arranged cells are changed over every iteration purely based on the properties of each cell's immediately adjacent cells. Each cellular automata progresses based on a rule, simple or complex as it may be. 

This project contains celluar automata of various complexities. Each directory contains the script for generating a model with its rule included as a .txt file. The General Case directory conatins the raw, rule-less script that may be used to generate cellular automata with custom rules. 

Although some of these rules may be simple, they may produce unpredictable, globally complex patterns.
